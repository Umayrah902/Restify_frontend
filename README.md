# Restify_frontend

The front-end of the Restify app. This includes the code written in JavaScript and React and the associated static pages that were used to initially design the layout of the application in the initial phases of the project.

To run the front-end, cd into the my-app directory and run the startup.sh and run.sh files in that order.
